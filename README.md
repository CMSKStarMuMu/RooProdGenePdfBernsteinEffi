# RooProdGenePdfBernsteinEffi
testGeneReFit <= Usage: ./testGeneReFit    [Q2Bin]    [where QBin2=0,1,2,3,5,7,8]

            This program: 
	    
		- contains a full example of the use of the efficiency class RooProdGenePdfBernsteinEffi (efficiency X P-Wave) in roofit 

		- reads the RECO events 2016 from a flat ntupla provided by Sara, using the last BDT;
		
		- the Mass cust 
	    
		- reads the model list parameters ListGenValues-2016-Q2Bin-[Q2Bin].txt, previously generated by testGene;
	    
		- reads the efficiency coefficents for the Bernstein Polynomial from  ListParValues-2016-Q2Bin-[Q2Bin]-Bins-25-25-25-BernDeg-[max1]-[max2]-[max3]-integraBin.plo where max1,max2,max3 are the maximum polynomial degrees for cosL,cosK and phi;
	    
		- fits the reconstructed events angular distribution with a UML of the P-wave (PDF) X (Efficiency);
	    
		- produces the output file testGeneReFit-2016-Q2Bin-[Q2Bin]-Bins-[n. bins CosL]-[n. bins CosK]-[n. bins Phi]-BernDeg-[max1]-[max2]-[max3]-integraBin.root, with a the canvas "ClosurePlots" where are stored the projections of the reco distribution and, superimposed in red, the fit.
